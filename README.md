This application is positioned as local movie catalog. It catalogs files in selected directories.

To succesfully run this app you need installed Java jde version 8 or >. Or Java jde + JavaFx.

To run app go to root directory and run `./run` script. 

To add directory go to `Edit` select `Add path`. In poped up window select path of directory and point category of this directory. App will check this directory contents and add them do database.

There is still some not working features like selecting videos by category. I'll finish them later. If you have some ideas feel free to propose them.
